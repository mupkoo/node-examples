# Node Example

Node example is a library with things I built, while I am testing
NodeJS and some of the community packages. You can start them easily
by running `node {apps_folder_name}`

## List of the example apps

* [/todos](#todos) - Simple Todos app

## Todos

Very simple implementation of a todos app, using plain node with in memory storage.
To start the app just run `node todos` and navigation to _localhost:8000_
